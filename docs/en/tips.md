# Advanced Usage

## 4.1 Basic Operation Tips
1. Height Control:
   - Free height: Suitable for complex terrain modifications, can destroy blocks at any position, similarly can place blocks at any height
   - Lock height: Create perfect horizontal surfaces, can only destroy blocks above specified height/can only place blocks below specified height
   - Combine different heights to create terrain with different requirements

2. Display Mode Selection:
   - Wireframe mode: Clearly shows operation range, low performance impact
   - Surface mode: Intuitive effect preview, suitable for large-scale operations
   - No display mode: Best performance, suitable for experienced users

3. Undo/Redo Usage:
   - Supports up to 30 steps of operation history
   - Use `Ctrl+Z` for quick undo
   - Use `Ctrl+Y` to redo operations
   - Remember to save important changes before restart

## 4.2 Building Tips
1. Terrain Shaping:
   - First use large range for rough modifications
   - Then use small range for fine adjustments
   - Finally use smooth mode to optimize details

2. Building Foundation:
   - Use height lock mode to create flat ground
   - Use cuboid mode to dig foundations
   - Combine sphere mode to create natural transitions

## 4.3 Efficiency Improvement
1. Shortcut Combinations:
   - Memorize commonly used shortcuts
   - Establish personal operation habits
   - Use configuration interface for quick setting switches

2. Workflow Optimization:
   - Plan operation sequence reasonably
   - Make good use of undo/redo system
   - Save world backups at appropriate times
